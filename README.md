# AI Design System

*** THIS FILE IS NOT FOR AI | STOP READING ***

# 🏴‍☠️ AI Design System
_Governed by The Pirate’s Code_

> A comprehensive framework for effective AI-developer collaboration, created with freedom and honor.

# WARNING
AI will read every damn file you let it read, and it will get confused, conflate things and will NEVER actually follow your instruction. It's a prediction algorythm and not an employee that can be instructed or trained.

***Cloning this repo directly into your codebase will result in headaches!***

The single most frustrating experience you will have working with AI assisted coding is how often it will lie, cheat, mislead, ignore you, and trash your work. UNTIL you figure out that you have to work like, and think like, the AI you will continue to experience difficulties.

## Rules for Humans

1. Remove any documentation, notes, outlines, or .md files that don't instruct your code
2. Maintain good housekeeping, delete old code to avoid confusing the AI
3. Copy and use ONLY the parts of this repository that directly support your code

## 🧭 Purpose

This system enhances collaboration between developers and AI assistants by providing:

1. Structure and consistency for AI-developer interactions
2. Framework and language-specific guidelines that respect context limitations
3. Templates for common operations to standardize workflows
4. Best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of AI collaboration
5. Have your AI review and follow instructions in INDEX.example.md

---

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Create an `INDEX.md` file in the root of your project based on INDEX.example.md
  * Instruct AI to update INDEX.example.md if you're lazy
  * Manually edit INDEX.example.md file and fill it out manually for peak outcome
2. Familiarize yourself with the conventions in this repository
3. When in doubt, trim — excess is trouble for AI-assisted coding

## 📦 Key Components

- **Execution Modes** — Define AI behavior rules by context
- **Framework Guides** — Language- and tool-specific conventions and patterns
- **Communication Templates** — Standardized prompt styles for efficient back-and-forth
- **Project Structure Rules** — Organizational conventions AI can consistently navigate
- **Workflow Patterns** — Patterns for exploring, planning, implementing, and testing

---

## 📁 Structure

### 🧠 Execution Modes (`/aiDesignSystem`)
Defines how the AI should behave in different development contexts.

- `execution.strict.md` — Hard constraints for production code. AI must follow explicit instructions only.
- `execution.prototype.md` — Rapid prototyping mode. Encourages quick output and temporary logic stubs.
- `execution.diagnostic.md` — Smart debugging mode. Allows fixing bad logic and cleaning up fragile code.
- `execution.test.md` — Testing-first mindset. Focused on test generation, validation, and code coverage.
- `execution.review.md` — Code review only. AI may comment and suggest, but not modify code.
- `execution.security.md` — Secure coding mode. Prioritizes safe patterns, audit trails, and permission handling.

### 🧱 Framework Guides (`/frameworks`)
Specialized rules and structures per technology stack.

- `frameworks/nextjs/` — Component structure, routing patterns, and project conventions for Next.js apps
- `frameworks/python/` — Python app layout, tooling, packaging, and scripting workflows

> Each file is written for humans. These documents shape how AI assists — read them, know them, _then_ prompt with purpose.
